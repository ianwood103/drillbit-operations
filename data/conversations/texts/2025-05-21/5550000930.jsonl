Can you promise the first tech that comes will definitely fix it? And that I won’t pay too much?","actions":[],"status":"active","reason":null,"job_type":"hvac","urgency":5,"operator_id":null}
{"timestamp":"2025-05-21T09:42:12Z","phone":5550000930,"sender_type":"agent","content":"Thank you, Linda! I completely understand wanting things done right without surprises. While we can’t guarantee the final cost or that a fix will be immediate before a technician sees your system, we do everything we can to be prompt and clear. If you’d like, I can provide a general estimate, but sometimes an in-person diagnosis is needed for accuracy. Could I get your address, so I can check if you’re in our service area and give you the best info?","actions":[],"status":"active","reason":null,"job_type":"hvac","urgency":5,"operator_id":null}

I’ve had three different companies say the same. Why should I believe yours is different? Last time someone said it was the compressor, but then it wasn’t. And before I even think about booking, I need a real ballpark price. I’m retired, I can’t be throwing money away.","actions":[],"status":"active","reason":null,"job_type":"hvac","urgency":5,"operator_id":null}

Our technicians are certified and experienced, and we strive for honest communication every step of the way. Prices can vary depending on the actual issue, but if you can tell me more--for example, does your air conditioner make any noise, is it blowing warm air, or does it turn on at all? That will help me give you a better estimate.","actions":[],"status":"active","reason":null,"job_type":"hvac","urgency":5,"operator_id":null}

Look, maybe I’ll just need to live with this. It’s just always the same story. Plus, I hate getting my hopes up for nothing.","actions":[],"status":"active","reason":null,"job_type":"hvac","urgency":5,"operator_id":null}
{"timestamp":"2025-05-21T11:00:05Z","phone":5550000930,"sender_type":"agent","content":"I really do want to help, Linda. If you’d like, I can arrange an in-person visit where the tech will diagnose the issue and explain the costs before any work is done. That way, you can decide before moving forward. There’s no obligation to proceed if you’re not comfortable. Would you like to try scheduling a time, and you can always cancel if it doesn’t seem right?","actions":[],"status":"active","reason":null,"job_type":"hvac","urgency":5,"operator_id":null}
