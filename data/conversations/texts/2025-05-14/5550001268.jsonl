{"timestamp":"2025-05-14T10:19:52Z","phone":5550001268,"sender_type":"agent","content":"Thank you! You're within our service area. The cost to fix an AC can vary a lot, but typical repairs usually start around $100, depending on what's needed. For the most accurate estimate, we usually do an in-person assessment. Would you like to schedule a technician to come out and take a look at your AC?","actions":[{"type":"get_price_estimate","result":"success","error":null}],"status":"active","reason":null,"job_type":"hvac","urgency":10,"operator_id":null}
{"timestamp":"2025-05-14T10:23:01Z","phone":5550001268,"sender_type":"customer","content":"So it's *at least* $100? Or more? Does that include parts? What if they get here and I don't like the price?","actions":[],"status":"active","reason":null,"job_type":"hvac","urgency":10,"operator_id":null}
{"timestamp":"2025-05-14T10:23:02Z","phone":5550001268,"sender_type":"agent","content":"That's a great question. The initial $100 typically covers the diagnostic, which means a licensed tech will inspect your AC and let you know what's wrong. After that, the tech will give you a quote before any repairs start. If you decide not to move forward, you only pay for the diagnostic. Would you like to reserve a time for the diagnostic visit?","actions":[],"status":"active","reason":null,"job_type":"hvac","urgency":10,"operator_id":null}

{"timestamp":"2025-05-14T10:27:39Z","phone":5550001268,"sender_type":"agent","content":"I wish it was that easy! Without seeing the AC in person, it's really hard to know exactly what's causing those symptoms since many issues can cause similar problems. The good news is, you won't be obligated to approve any repairs beyond the diagnostic. Would you like to book an appointment, or is there something else I can help with?","actions":[],"status":"active","reason":null,"job_type":"hvac","urgency":10,"operator_id":null}
